- I will be in your neighborhood for work [earlier in the day](TOD) on [Monday](DATE) and I’m wondering if I could drop off some material before I come at [2:30](Time)? Including a large wheel of cheese, huge loaf(s) of bread and some slats that I found.
- Me and Dmitri will be stopping by [tomorrow](DATE) if that works. I'll bring a chess set, he'll bring a bottle of wine. I'll try to keep his, er, naturally boorish tendencies in check. When's a good time?
- I’m free anytime today example 1-3pm. Tomorrow is kinda loose, I could jump on a call whenever. Sunday I could talk at noon or after 4pm
- looks like Croissant will be reaching out (unless they already have) to set you up on a call with Robert Blake - the Dir of Eng for Data. Let me know when they reach out and its get scheduled. Thanks, [Mark](nou) (Synergy)
